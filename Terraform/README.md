# What is Terraform
Firstly, is a IaC tool from Hasicorp. Terraform is used for building, changing, destroying, and versioning infrastrcuture. Many will think of Terraform as a IaC language, 
although we will refere to it as a IaC tool. 
It is, technically, a programming lanaguage as it has it's own syntax in order to configure Terraform and thereby infrastructure. The syntax/language is called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
